## Beep Boop

This is just a couple of programs to demonstrate how I used write
music code on an IBM PC back in the early 80s. I used
[PC-BASIC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcbasic/) on OSX,
but I think most any
BASIC emulator should run these. They play snippets of
Michael Jackson's "Smooth Criminal" and Van Halen's "Eruption."

Happy beeping!
